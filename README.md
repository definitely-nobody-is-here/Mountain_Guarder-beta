# How to Play

### Global Public Server
Play free today at [mountainguarder.herokuapp.com](https://mountainguarder.herokuapp.com)! Just go click the link, create an account, and play Mountain Guarder free, anytime, anywhere! (as long as you have WiFi)

### Installation
##### Local Installation
I cannot distribute Node.js as I do not own any rights to it, but visiting [their website](https://nodejs.org/) you can download the LTS version and install it, **checking the box "Automatically install necessary tools"**. NPM should install with it. Wait for the installation to finish, then [download the code](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it into a new folder. Alternatively you can [clone the repsository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) so you can keep your server up to date without redownloading the files. Then open command prompt, navigate to the folder you placed the server in, and run `npm install` to download the required dependencies. If you want to use a global PostgreSQL database use the following. Install a [PostgreSQL server](https://www.postgresql.org/) or use an alternative PostgreSQL hosting site. Make sure you have the database attached to it by creating `url.js` in the `server` folder. Inside, place `url = '<database uri here>';`, replacing `<database uri here>` with your PostgreSQL uri. Make sure your database is running, and run `node app.js` in your command prompt. The server is started! Alternatively, locate `config.json` (or `config`) and set "offlineMode" to `true` and start the server using `node app.js`.
To stop the server, press Ctrl+C.
##### Heroku Installation
[![Deploy](https://www.Herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://Heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder)

### Joining the Game
Once the server is started, you can find your computer's name (available in Windows>System>About as "Device name"), or simply search [what's my ip](http://google.com/search?q=whats+my+ip) or click the link. The server console will tell you what port to visit and you can type either the ip address or computer name on the client side **connected to the same network as the host** and then followed by a `:` and then the port number. Example: `111.22.33.444:2000` or `hostcomputer:1100`. The port will always be 4000.

### Gameplay
Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/wiki) for more information.

# Troubleshooting
#### There are errors
If you are getting errors or something seems broken (missing textures, stuff flying around all over your screen, something gets stuck) you can [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) including a screenshot of the problem and the most recent logs and any errors.
#### My Server Crashed
In the case that your server crashes, verify that there is a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/) connected to your server, all dependencies are installed correctly, and that the server has an internet connection. If you have verified that the server has all necessary addons to run and the server still crashed, [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) including a screenshot of the most recent logs and any error messages on the client or server.
#### I can't Connect to the Server (ERROR_Connection_Refused)
If you can't connect to the server and are running it locally without a hosting service, verify that:
 - The server is running
 - You have entered the correct port number and hostname
 - You are connected to the same WiFi network as the server
If you have verified all four of the above, try restarting the server. If your server is running on a hosting service (like Heroku) check that your link is correct.
#### The Server is Slow
There is nothing we can do about this. It could be your connection speed or a slow server unable to run the game at full speed. Press "backslash" (`\`) ingame and in the top-right corner it should list TPS and Ping. If your Ping is high then that is likely the source of your lag. If you TPS is low then the server is lagging. Check that there is nothing eating your computer's resources by opening Task Manager (Windows) by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc.

If you can't resolve your problem after trying these solutions or your problem is not on this page, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues) page and [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) and fill out as much information as possible.
