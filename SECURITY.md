# Security Policy

## Database URL

The database URL will not be disclosed, since it contains sensitive information and releasing such information will allow people entry to the database, allowing them to delete, inject, and modify user accounts. So please, don't ask for it, you can create your own database for your own servers. For more information on creating a database, visit [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Supported Versions

Supported Versions are stable versions that can run without interfering with the database. Run non-supported versions at your own risk.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.8.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.6.x   | :x:                |
